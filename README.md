## Hi! I'm Esythara!

I'm a 19 year old Web Developer that has experience utilising, HTML, CSS (SASS), PHP, SQL, Frameworks (Laravel, Bootstrap4) and back-end site management. 

I previously worked in a position in Derby where I was able to briefly work with a Lead Web Developer until the date of his resignation. Working hand in hand with site-management, utilising Plesk, Namecheap (SSL), Security, FTP Access, phpMyAdmin, SequelPro, BitBucket and more. 

A hard worker is how I'd describe myself with a unique way of working and delivering. During my tenure I was faced with challenges of the Lead's role upon his leave, finding ways to troubleshoot issues alone, setting up live environments through Homestead/Sage, working closely with the Graphic Design department and frequently liaising with customers.

An eye for detail and open-minded to new techniques. A variety user of different platforms for coding such as Sublime Text, Atom, Unity, and Brackets.

Animals, music, art and games are peak interests. With 3 guitars and 2 pianos, 11 years expeience, 4 cats and a love for gaming, I express interest in embarking into a company that's ready to take on a fanatic.
